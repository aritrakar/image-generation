# ML from scratch

This repository houses notebooks containing implementations of common machine learning mechanisms from scratch. The mechanisms included are:

1. Perceptron and Multi-layer perceptron
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
1. Transformers
1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
1. Adversarial Training of an image classifier for robustness

See each notebook for more details.
